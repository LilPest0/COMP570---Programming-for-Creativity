Student: Benji Gifford - ID#42069

## 7/03/2023
 - Reviewed assignment in class
 - Typed starter code and ran it
 - added the line surface.setResizable(true); to the end of the setup() function
 - added the shapes on both sides and colored them
 - the top shapes were green and the bottom were red, but the intent was to have the left ones green and the right ones red
 - also, the right elipse wasn't generating

### Progress
 - As of now, the top two shapes are both green, and the bottom square is red. The bottom elipse currently does not exist,
 due to programming errors. Will attempt to fix. I think i got the coordinates wrong
 - additionally, upon left-clicking, the background changes to a random grayscale
 - NOTE: The goal is to have a rectangle and an elipse on each side of the window, with the left ones being red and the right ones being green

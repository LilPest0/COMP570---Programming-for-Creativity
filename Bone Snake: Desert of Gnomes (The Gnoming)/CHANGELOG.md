## 17/05/2023
Research:
 - Reviewed assignment in class
 - Researched snake-type games made in Processing
 - found images to use for the desert background, the worm's head and its segments 
 Game:
 - created a very basic snake game with randomly spawning "enemies" that dont move or shoot,
   and the snake can eat them and grow longer. as of now, the snake is invincible and can cross itself without dying

## 23/5/2023
 - Added a background image to the game, and created the enemies as pixelart gnomes
 - Developed a title screen
 - Obtained sound effects and background music, and started implementing them into the program
 - Created separate tabs for the snake and the gnomes

## 28/5/2023
 - Research

## 29/5/2023
 - My plan is now to have a tab for the start screen, this tab for the main game, and another tab for the "game over"
   - Every time the snake eats a gnome, a spike ball will spawn in at a random location. if you touch one of the spike balls, you die

## 30/5/2023
 - Implemented a start screen to the game. When you press enter, the game starts.
 - Created a "game over" screen
 - Implemented a scoring system (Eating 1 gnome gives you 1 point, score is dispayed at endgame)
 - Added mortality (The snake can now die by running into a cactus. A new cactus is randomly placed on the map every time a gnome is eaten)

 ## 31/5/2023
 - Added a high score system. It uses a txt file and constantly updates it whenever a new high score is achieved.
 - Added snake graphics, with a head and body segments. It is no longer a line of squares, and the head and segments turn in the snake's direction of movement
 - Game now restarts when you press ENTER
 - Added background music and eating/death sound effects
 - Optimized code and went into more detail with the comments
